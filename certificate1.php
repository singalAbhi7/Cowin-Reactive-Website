        <p>One registration per person is sufficient. Please do not register with multiple mobile numbers or different Photo ID Proofs for same <br> individual.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Scheduling of Second dose should be done from the same account (same mobile number) from which the first dose has been <br> taken, for generation of final certificate. Separate registration for second dose is not necessary.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Please carry the registered mobile phone and the requisite documents, including appointment slip, the Photo ID card used for <br> registration, Employment Certificate (HCW/FLW) etc., while visiting the vaccination center, for verification at the time of <br> vaccination.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Please check for additional eligibility conditions, if any, prescribed by the respective State/UT Government for vaccination at <br> Government Vaccination Centers, for 18-44 age group, and carry the other prescribed documents (e.g. Comorbidity Certificate etc.) <br> as suggested by respective State/UT (on their website).</p> 
        <br>
        <p>The slots availability is displayed in the search (on district, pincode or map) based on the schedule populated by the DIOs (for <br> Government Vaccination Centers) and private hospitals for their vaccination centers.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>The vaccination schedule published by DIOs and private hospitals displays the list of vaccination centers with the following <br> information</p> 
        <ol>
            <br>
            <li>The vaccine type.</li>
            <li>The age group (18-44/45+ etc.).</li> 
            <li>The number of slots available for dose 1 and dose 2.</li>
            <li>Whether the service is Free or Paid (Vaccination is free of cost at all the Government Vaccination Centers).</li>
            <li>Per dose price charged by a private hospital.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>If you are seeking 1st dose vaccination, the system will show you only the available slots for dose 1. Similarly, if you are due for <br> 2nd dose, the system will show you the available slots for dose 2 after the minimum period from the date of 1st dose vaccination <br> has elapsed.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Once a session has been published by the DIO/ private hospital, the session now can not be cancelled. However, the session may <br> be rescheduled. In case you have booked an appointment in any such vaccination session that is rescheduled for any reason, your <br> appointment will also be automatically rescheduled accordingly. You will receive a confirmation SMS in this regard. On such <br> rescheduling, you would still have the option of cancelling or further rescheduling such appointment.</p>
